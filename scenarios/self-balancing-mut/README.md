#SELF-ADAPTATION SCENARIO FOR MASTER THESIS

---
This is a edited scenario for using in the master thesis. It is based on the mt-image, but has mutated selfbalancing approach.

Mutation test case:
Mutations generated by [universalmutator](https://github.com/agroce/universalmutator). This is the mutation scenario which will be used in the case study for the master thesis.

In this scenario, a new self-balancing approach works along with vanilla Hadoop cluster.
This approach can dynamically tune hadoop configuration to automatically balance job parallelism and job throughput  while processing concurrent workloads.

We have published two papers on this self-balancing approach:

[Self-Balancing Job Parallelism and Throughput in Hadoop](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01294834)

[Self-configuration of the Number of Concurrently Running MapReduce Jobs in a Hadoop Cluster](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01143157)

The self-balancing approach is realized by a feedback control loop based on typical MAPE cycle as shown below:

Concluding with many experiments of various Mapreduce jobs, we can say that this approach can obviously improve the system performance of Hadoop cluster while processing concurrent workloads.
